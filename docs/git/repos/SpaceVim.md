# The source code of SpaceVim 

The source code of SpaceVim is hosted in an online repository and can be cloned locally to view the source code.

```
git clone https://spacevim.org/git/repos/SpaceVim/
```

Since the code was previously hosted on GitHub, some old users need to manually modify the remote repository address:

```
cd ~/.SpaceVim
git remote set-url origin https://spacevim.org/git/repos/SpaceVim/
```

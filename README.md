# SpaceVim

Github forces user to enable 2FA, and I can't log in anymore.

So this repository was deleted, and we use custom url now.

- For old SpaceVim users, follow these steps:

```
cd ~/.SpaceVim
git remote set-url origin https://spacevim.org/git/repos/SpaceVim/
```

- For new users, checkout the [quick start guide](https://spacevim.org/quick-start-guide/) to install SpaceVim.
